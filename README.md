# Subspace-Thingies
My tools and utils for the Subspace Network.  

Ping me on the Subspace Discord (Wolfrage) if you have any questions.  No DMs though -- DMs are the Devil's handjob.

Known Issues:
Wallet monitor thingy will crash out if your node goes down.  I'll add handling when I get around to it.
There is no option to disable logging to file for the Farm monitor yet.  I'll get that added and maybe log rotation too, at some point.

*** Don't judge my code, you uncouth heathens!  Figuring stuff out first, then I'll make it nice and pretty. Well, pretty-ish. Whatever. I'm having fun. ***
