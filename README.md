-Farm Monitor Thingy: Will launch the Farmer and capture its output to a log and to screen, filtering the log to notify you (log, screen, discord, etc) of events. It also converts log timestamp to your local timezone. Also monitors your wallet for balance changes.  More features coming. 

This have BASIC retrys. Let me know if they don't work, and what the error was.
Ping me on the Subspace Discord (Wolfrage) if you have any questions.  No DMs though -- DMs are the Devil's handjob.
